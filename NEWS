		CHANGES IN GEOMORPH VERSION 1.1-2

NEW FEATURES

    o pairwiseD.test() function added

    o bilat.symmetry() output includes symmetric and asymmetric shape components

BUG FIXES 

    o Corrected readland.tps() to allow for non-numeric ID and reading a single specimen per file

    o Corrected landmark plotting issue and added greater directory flexibility in curves2D() 

    o Added greater directory flexibility and fixed header output in digitize2D() 

    o Added greater flexibility in reading distinct file formats in read.morphologika()

    o Corrected angle calculations in fixed.angle()

    o Corrected plotting of deformations grids in plotTangentSpace()
 
    o Corrected ancestral state output in physignal() and PlotGMPhyloMorphoSpace()

OTHER CHANGES

    o Adjusted plotting routines in morphol.integr() to be compatible with new CRAN guidelines

    o Adjusted plotting routines in bilat.symmetry() to be compatible with new CRAN guidelines

    o Alternative ancestral state reconstruction and tests for bifurcating tree implemeneted in physignal()

    o Alternative ancestral state reconstruction and tests for bifurcating tree implemeneted in PlotGMPhyloMorphoSpace()
