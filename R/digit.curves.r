#' Calculate semilandmarks along a curve
#'
#' A function that "digitizes curves" by calculating equidistant two-dimensional or three-dimensional semilandmarks along 
#' a curve. These landmarks will be treated as "sliders" in Generalized Procrustes analysis \code{\link{gpagen}}. This 
#' type of semilandmark "slides" along curves lacking known landmarks (see Bookstein 1997 for algorithm details). Each 
#' sliding semilandmark ("sliders") will slide between two designated points, along a line tangent to the specified 
#' curvature, as specified by \code{\link{define.sliders}}. 
#'
#' The function is based upon tpsDig2 'resample curve by length' for 2D data by James Rohlf (Rohlf 2015).
#' The start of the curve is a fixed landmark on the curve that is equivalent (homologous) in each specimen in the 
#' sample (and will be treated as a fixed point during Procrustes Superimposition using \code{\link{gpagen}}). Then 
#' nPoints are calculated along the curve at equidistant points from the start to the end. 
#' 
#' 'curve' is a p-x-k matrix of 2D or 3D coordinates for a set of ordered points defining a curve. This can be the pixels 
#' of an outline calculated in ImageJ (save xy coordinates) or any other reasonable way of obtaining ordered coordinates
#'  along a curve (including sampling by hand using \code{\link{digit.fixed}} or \code{\link{digitize2d}} - but note 
#'  that there should be more points defining the curve than nPoints in order to accurately calculate the semilandmarks).
#'
#' If 'closed = T', the function returns the coordinates of the 'start' landmark plus nPoints. If 'closed = F', the 
#' function returns the coordinates of the 'start' landmark, plus nPoints and the end of the curve. 
#' 
#' If unsure if the points defining the curve are ordered, then plot and color them using the rainbow function, 
#' e.g. plot(curve, pch=19, cex=0.1, col=rainbow(nrow(outline))), and it should be easy to visualize.
#'
#' @param start A numeric vector of x,y,(z) coordinates for the landmark defining the start of the curve (can be simply first point on open outline: curve[1,])
#' @param curve A matrix (p x k) of 2D or 3D coordinates for a set of ordered points defining a curve
#' @param nPoints Numeric how many semilandmarks to place equidistantly along the curve (not counting beginning and end points) 
#' @param closed Logical Whether the curve is closed (TRUE) or open (FALSE)
#' @return Function returns a matrix of coordinates for nPoints equally spaced semilandmarks sampled along the curve (plus start and end if 'closed = F', or only including start if 'closed = T') 
#' @seealso \code{\link{digit.fixed}} \code{\link{digitize2d}}
