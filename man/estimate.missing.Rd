\title{Estimate locations of missing landmarks}
\usage{
estimate.missing(A, method = c("TPS", "Reg"))
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{An array (p x k x n) containing landmark coordinates for a set of specimens or a geomorphShapes object}

\item{method}{Method for estimating missing landmark locations}
}
\value{
Function returns an array (p x k x n) of the same dimensions as input A, including coordinates for the target specimens 
(the original landmarks plus the estimated coordinates for the missing landmarks).
If the input is a geomorphShapes object, this is returned with the original and estimated coordinates in $landmarks
In both cases, these data need to be Procrustes Superimposed prior to analysis, including sliding of semilandmarks (see \code{\link{gpagen}}).

\description{
A function for estimating the locations of missing landmarks
}
\details{
The function estimates the locations of missing landmarks for incomplete specimens  in a set of landmark
configurations, where missing landmarks in the incomplete specimens are designated by NA in place 
of the x,y,z coordinates.  Two distinct approaches are implemented.

The first approach (method = "TPS") uses the thin-plate spline to interpolate landmarks on a reference specimen to estimate 
the locations of missing landmarks on a target specimen. Here, a reference specimen is obtained from 
the set of specimens for which all landmarks are present, Next, each incomplete specimen is aligned to 
the reference using the set of landmarks common to both. Finally, the thin-plate spline is used 
to estimate the locations of the missing landmarks in the target specimen (Gunz et al. 2009).

The second approach (method = "Reg") is multivariate regression. Here each landmark with missing values is
regressed on all other landmarks for the set of complete specimens, and the missing landmark values are
then predicted by this linear regression model. Because the number of variables can exceed the number of
specimens, the regression is implemented on scores along the first set of PLS axes for the complete and 
incomplete blocks of landmarks (see Gunz et al. 2009). Note, however, that a minimum of k*m+k specimens 
are required to estimate m missing landmarks (of k-dimension) in any one specimen using the regression method.
More generally, if the number of missing landmarks approaches the number of reference specimens used to 
estimate them, estimation will become increasingly imprecise with the regression method. Additionally, 
the location of missing landmarks (contiguous versus disparate in location) can also influence the precision 
of estimation.  The user should be aware that the function will produce results but the results from the 
regression method might be influenced by the number of specimens, the number of total landmarks, and the 
number and location of missing landmarks in any one specimen.  It might be wise to compare multiple methods 
for specific cases, if uncertain about the precision of estimation.
 
 One can also exploit bilateral symmetry to estimate the locations of missing landmarks. Several
  possibilities exist for implementing this approach (see Gunz et al. 2009).  Example R code for one 
  implementation is found in Claude (2008).
 
NOTE: Because all geometric morphometric analyses and plotting functions implemented in geomorph 
require a full complement of landmark coordinates, the alternative to estimating the missing 
landmark coordinates is to proceed with subsequent analyses EXCLUDING
specimens with missing values.
