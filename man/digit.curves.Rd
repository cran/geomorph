\title{Calculate semilandmarks along a curve}
\usage{
digit.curves(start, curve, nPoints, closed = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{start}{A numeric vector of x,y,(z) coordinates for the landmark defining the start of the curve (can be simply first point on open outline: curve[1,])}

\item{curve}{A matrix (p x k) of 2D or 3D coordinates for a set of ordered points defining a curve}

\item{nPoints}{Numeric how many semilandmarks to place equidistantly along the curve (not counting beginning and end points)}

\item{closed}{Logical Whether the curve is closed (TRUE) or open (FALSE)}
}
\value{
Function returns a matrix of coordinates for nPoints equally spaced semilandmarks sampled along the curve (plus start and end if 'closed = F', or only including start if 'closed = T')
}
\description{
A function that "digitizes curves" by calculating equidistant two-dimensional or three-dimensional semilandmarks along 
a curve. These landmarks will be treated as "sliders" in Generalized Procrustes analysis \code{\link{gpagen}}. This 
type of semilandmark "slides" along curves lacking known landmarks (see Bookstein 1997 for algorithm details). Each 
sliding semilandmark ("sliders") will slide between two designated points, along a line tangent to the specified 
curvature, as specified by \code{\link{define.sliders}}.
}
\details{
The function is based upon tpsDig2 'resample curve by length' for 2D data by James Rohlf (Rohlf 2015).
The start of the curve is a fixed landmark on the curve that is equivalent (homologous) in each specimen in the 
sample (and will be treated as a fixed point during Procrustes Superimposition using \code{\link{gpagen}}). Then 
nPoints are calculated along the curve at equidistant points from the start to the end. 

'curve' is a p-x-k matrix of 2D or 3D coordinates for a set of ordered points defining a curve. This can be the pixels 
of an outline calculated in ImageJ (save xy coordinates) or any other reasonable way of obtaining ordered coordinates
 along a curve (including sampling by hand using \code{\link{digit.fixed}} or \code{\link{digitize2d}} - but note 
 that there should be more points defining the curve than nPoints in order to accurately calculate the semilandmarks).

If 'closed = T', the function returns the coordinates of the 'start' landmark plus nPoints. If 'closed = F', the 
function returns the coordinates of the 'start' landmark, plus nPoints and the end of the curve. 

If unsure if the points defining the curve are ordered, then plot and color them using the rainbow function, 
e.g. plot(curve, pch=19, cex=0.1, col=rainbow(nrow(outline))), and it should be easy to visualize.
