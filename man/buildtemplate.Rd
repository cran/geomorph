\title{Build 3D surface template}
\usage{
buildtemplate(spec, fixed, center = TRUE, surface.sliders, ptsize = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{spec}{An object of class shape3d/mesh3d, or matrix of 3D vertex coordinates}

\item{fixed}{Either a numeric value designating the number of fixed landmarks to be selected by \code{\link{digit.fixed}}, or a matrix of 3D coordinates collected previously}

\item{center}{Should the object 'spec' be centered prior to digitizing?}

\item{surface.sliders}{The number of desired surface sliders}

\item{ptsize}{Size of mesh points (vertices), e.g. 0.1 for dense meshes, 3 for sparse meshes}
}
\value{
The function writes to the working directory three files: an NTS file with the name of the 
specimen and .nts suffix containing the landmark coordinates, "template.txt" containing the same 
coordinates for use with the function \code{\link{digitsurface}}, and "surfslide.csv", a file 
containing the address of the landmarks defined as "surface sliders" for use with \code{\link{gpagen}}.
The function also returns to the console an n x 3 matrix containing the x,y,z coordinates of the 
digitized landmarks.

\description{
An interactive function to build a template for the digitization across 
specimens of three dimensional (3D) surface sliding semilandmarks. Input 
for the function is either a matrix of vertex coordinates
 defining a 3D surface object or a mesh3d object as obtained 
 from \code{\link{read.ply}}.
}
\details{
Function constructs a template of surface slider semilandmarks. If desired, the user can simultaneously 
digitize the fixed points (see digitizing below), however these may have been previously digitized separately 
using \code{\link{digit.fixed}}.

The function finds surface semilandmarks, chosen automatically from the mesh at roughly equal distances,
using the nearest-neighbor algorithm outlined in Gunz et al. (2005) and Mitteroecker and Gunz (2009). 

The set of fixed and surface slider landmarks are saved in the working directory as a txt file named "template". 
This file will then be used to extract a set of similarly numbered surface semilandmarks on subsequent specimens 
using the function \code{\link{digitsurface}}. Because template matching is based on the correspondence of fixed 
landmark points in the template and the target specimen, a minimum of four fixed landmarks must be used. However,  
to ensure a strong match between the scan and the template, it is recommended that a 
higher number of fixed points is used.

For more details see the vignette: \code{vignette("geomorph.digitize3D")}.

 NOTE: Function centers the mesh before digitizing by default (center = TRUE). If one chooses not to 
 center, the specimen may be difficult to manipulate in the rgl window.

\subsection{Digitizing}{
Digitizing of fixed landmarks is interactive. Once a point is selected, the user is asked if the system should keep or discard the 
selection (y/n). If "y", the user is asked to continue to select the next landmark. If "n" the removes the last chosen
landmark, and the user is asked to select it again. This can be repeated until the user is comfortable with the landmark
chosen. 

To digitize with a standard 3-button (PC):
\enumerate{
 \item the RIGHT mouse button (primary) to select points to be digitized,
 \item the LEFT mouse button (secondary) is used to rotate mesh, 
 \item the mouse SCROLLER (third/middle) is used to zoom in and out.
}
NOTE: Digitizing functions on MACINTOSH computers using a standard 3-button mice works as specified. 
Macs using platform specific single button mice, XQuartz must be configured: go to 
Preferences > Input > tick "Emulate three button mouse":
\enumerate{
 \item press button to rotate 3D mesh,
 \item press button while pressing COMMAND key to select vertex to be used as a landmark),
 \item press button while pressing OPTION key to adjust mesh perspective.
 \item the mouse SCROLLER or trackpad two finger scroll is used to zoom in an out.
 }

NOTE: there is no pan (translate) functionality in rgl library for all platforms at this time.
The template can be edited using function \code{\link{editTemplate}}. 
}

\subsection{AUTO mode}{ 
The function as described above (for interactive mode) calls \code{\link{digit.fixed}}, prompting 
the user to select fixed landmarks in the rgl window. However if the user has digitized these fixed 
landmark elsewhere (e.g., in other software), then the input for parameter 'fixed' can be a 
p-x-k matrix of 3D coordinates. In this case, the function will automatically use these landmarks to build the 
template of sliding semilandmarks.
