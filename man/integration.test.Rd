\arguments{
\item{A}{A 3D array (p x k x n) containing Procrustes shape variables for all specimens, or a matrix (n x variables)}

\item{A2}{An optional 3D array (p x k x n) containing Procrustes shape variables for all specimens, or a matrix (n x variables) for a second partition}

\item{partition.gp}{A list of which landmarks (or variables) belong in which partition: 
(e.g. A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C). Required when only 1 dataset provided.}

\item{iter}{Number of iterations for significance testing}

\item{seed}{An optional argument for setting the seed for random permutations of the resampling procedure.
If left NULL (the default), the exact same P-values will be found for repeated runs of the analysis (with the same number of iterations).
If seed = "random", a random seed will be used, and P-values will vary.  One can also specify an integer for specific seed values,
which might be of interest for advanced users.}

This is helpful for long-running analyses.}

\description{
Function quantifies the degree of morphological integration between modules of Procrustes shape variables
}
\details{
The function quantifies the degree of morphological integration between modular partitions of shape data as 
  defined by Procrustes shape variables. It is assumed that the landmarks have previously been aligned using 
  Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) [e.g., with \code{\link{gpagen}}]. The function may be used to assess
  the degree of morphological integration between two or more sets of variables. 
  
  The function estimates the degree of morphological integration using a two-block partial least squares 
  analysis (PLS). When used with landmark data, this analysis is referred to as singular warps analysis 
  (Bookstein et al. 2003). If more than two partitions are defined, the average pairwise PLS correlation is utilized as
  the test statistic. The observed test value is then compared to a distribution of values obtained by randomly permuting 
  the individuals (rows) in one partition relative to those in the other. A significant result is found when the 
  observed PLS correlation is large relative to this distribution, and implies that the structures are integrated with one
  another (see Bookstein et al. 2003).  In addition, a multivariate effect size describing the strength of the effect is 
  estimated from the empirically-generated sampling distribution (see details in Adams and Collyer 2019).
  If only two partitions are specified, a plot of PLS scores along the first 
  set of PLS axes is optionally displayed, and thin-plate spline deformation grids along these axes are also shown if data were 
  input as a 3D array.  
  
 Input for the analysis can take one of two forms. First, one can input a single dataset (as a matrix or 3D array, along with 
 a vector describing which variables correspond to which partitions (for the case of a 3D array, which landmarks belong to which 
 partitions is specified). Alternatively, when evaluating the integration between two structures or partitions, two datasets may be provided.

 The generic functions, \code{\link{print}}, \code{\link{summary}}, and \code{\link{plot}} all work with \code{\link{integration.test}}.
 The generic function, \code{\link{plot}}, produces a two-block.pls plot.  This function calls \code{\link{plot.pls}}, which produces an ordination plot.  
 An additional argument allows one to include a vector to label points.  Starting with version 3.1.0, warpgrids are no longer available with \code{\link{plot.pls}}
 but after making a plot, the function returns values that can be used with \code{\link{picknplot.shape}} or a combination of 
\code{\link{shape.predictor}} and \code{\link{plotRefToTarget}} to visualize shape changes in the plot (via warpgrids).
 
\subsection{Similarity to \code{\link{two.b.pls}} and \code{\link{compare.pls}} }{ 
Note that \code{integration.test} performed on two matrices or arrays returns the same results as \code{\link{two.b.pls}}.  
However,  \code{\link{two.b.pls}} is limited to only two modules.  It might be of interest with 3+ modules to perform integration tests
between all pairwise comparisons of modules.  This can be done, test by test, and the levels of integration can be compared with
\code{\link{compare.pls}}.  Such results are different than using the average amount of integration, as performed by \code{integration.test}
when more than two modules are input.
}

 \subsection{Using phylogenies and PGLS}{ 
If one wishes to incorporate a phylogeny, \code{\link{phylo.integration}} is the function to use.  This function is exactly the same as \code{integration.test}
but allows PGLS estimation of PLS vectors.  Because \code{\link{integration.test}} can be used on two blocks, \code{\link{phylo.integration}} likewise allows one to
perform a phylogenetic two-block PLS analysis.
}
 
 \subsection{Notes for geomorph 3.0.4 and subsequent versions}{ 
 Compared to previous versions of geomorph, users might notice differences in effect sizes.  Previous versions used z-scores calculated with 
 expected values of statistics from null hypotheses (sensu Collyer et al. 2015); however Adams and Collyer (2016) showed that expected values 
 for some statistics can vary with sample size and variable number, and recommended finding the expected value, empirically, as the mean from the set 
 of random outcomes.  Geomorph 3.0.4 and subsequent versions now center z-scores on their empirically estimated expected values and where appropriate, 
 log-transform values to assure statistics are normally distributed.  This can result in negative effect sizes, when statistics are smaller than 
 expected compared to the average random outcome.  For ANOVA-based functions, the option to choose among different statistics to measure effect size 
 is now a function argument.
