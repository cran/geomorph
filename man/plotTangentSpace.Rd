\usage{
plotTangentSpace(A, axis1 = 1, axis2 = 2, warpgrids = TRUE, mesh = NULL,
  label = FALSE, groups = NULL, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{A}{An array (p x k x n) containing landmark
  coordinates for a set of aligned specimens}

  \item{warpgrids}{A logical value indicating whether
  deformation grids for shapes along X-axis should be
  displayed}

  \item{mesh}{A mesh3d object to be warped to represent
  shape deformation along X-axis (when {warpgrids=TRUE}) as
  described in \code{\link{plotRefToTarget}}.}

  \item{axis1}{A value indicating which PC axis should be
  displayed as the X-axis (default = PC1)}

  \item{axis2}{A value indicating which PC axis should be
  displayed as the X-axis (default = PC2)}

  \item{label}{A logical value indicating whether labels
  for each specimen should be displayed}

  \item{groups}{An optional factor vector specifying group
  identity for each specimen}

  \item{verbose}{A logical value indicating whether the
  output is basic or verbose (see Value below)}
}
\value{
Function returns a table summarizing the percent variation
explained by each pc axis (equivalent to summary() of
\code{\link{prcomp}}) (default, verbose = FALSE).  If
verbose=TRUE, function returns a list containing the
following components: \item{pc.summary}{A PC summary table
as above} \item{pc.scores}{The set of principal component
scores for all specimens.} \item{pc.shapes}{A list with
four components of the shape coordinates of the extreme
ends of axis1 and axis2 is returned, which can be used by
\code{\link{warpRefMesh}}.}
}
\description{
Function plots a set of Procrustes-aligned specimens in
tangent space along their principal axes
}
\details{
The function performs a principal components analysis of
shape variation and plots two dimensions of tangent space
for a set of Procrustes-aligned specimens (default is PC1
vs. PC2).  The percent variation along each PC-axis is
returned. Additionally (and optionally, {warpgrids=T}),
deformation grids can be requested, which display the shape
of specimens at the ends of the range of variability along
PC1. If groups are provided, specimens from each group are
plotted using distinct colors based on the order in which
the groups are found in the dataset, and using R's standard
color palette: black, red, green, blue, cyan, magenta,
yellow, and gray.
